# 🤖 Python for AI Agent Development

Welcome! This repository documents my personal journey toward becoming an **AI Agent Developer**—someone who builds intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.

## 🎯 Vision

To master the **Python programming language** with a focused, minimalistic learning approach—learning only what's necessary to:

- Understand how intelligent systems work.
- Build practical **AI agents**.
- Use these agents to solve meaningful, real-life challenges.

## 🚀 What This Repository Is About

This isn't just a random Python tutorial series. It’s a structured, evolving roadmap designed with a single destination in mind: **AI Agent Development**.

I’m sharing my progress publicly to stay accountable and maybe inspire or help others along the way.

## 🧠 How I’m Learning

- 📌 **Goal-Oriented**: Everything I learn is directly tied to building AI systems.
- 🧪 **Hands-On First**: Code-driven learning, not theory-heavy.
- 🪓 **No Wasted Steps**: If it doesn’t help my end goal, I skip it.

## 🛠️ Tools & Setup

- **Language**: Python 🐍  
- **IDE**: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub  
- **AI Coding Assistants**: [Gemini](https://deepmind.google), [Claude](https://claude.ai)  
- **OS**: Windows
