# 🤖 Python for AI Agent Development

Welcome! This repository documents my personal journey toward becoming an **AI Agent Developer**—someone who builds intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.

## 🎯 Vision

To master the **Python programming language** with a focused, minimalistic learning approach—learning only what's necessary to:

- Understand how intelligent systems work.
- Build practical **AI agents**.
- Use these agents to solve meaningful, real-life challenges.

## 🚀 What This Repository Is About

This isn't just a random Python tutorial series. It’s a structured, evolving roadmap designed with a single destination in mind: **AI Agent Development**.

I’m sharing my progress publicly to stay accountable and maybe inspire or help others along the way.
